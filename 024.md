# ERC5095.previewRedeem does not return the calculated result

## Summary
ERC5095.previewRedeem does not return the calculated result

## Vulnerability Detail
Post maturity, ERC5095.previewRedeem calculates the number of underlying tokens to return based on `s`, but here it returns s directly, not the calculated result
```solidity
    /// @notice Post or at maturity, simulates the effects of redeemption at the current block. Prior to maturity, returns the amount of `assets from a sale of `shares` in PT from a sale of PT on a YieldSpace AMM.
    /// @param s The amount of principal tokens redeemed in the simulation
    /// @return uint256 The amount of underlying returned by `shares` of PT redemption
    function previewRedeem(uint256 s) public view override returns (uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp >= maturity) {
            // After maturity, the amount redeemed is based on the Redeemer contract's holdings of the underlying
            Cast.u128(
                s *
                    Cast.u128(
                        IRedeemer(redeemer).holdings(underlying, maturity)
                    )
            ) / _totalSupply;
            return s;
        }

        // Prior to maturity, return a a preview of a swap on the pool
        return IYield(pool).sellFYTokenPreview(Cast.u128(s));
    }
```
## Impact
This makes the result returned by previewRedeem incorrect

## Recommendation
Change to
```diff
    function previewRedeem(uint256 s) public view override returns (uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp >= maturity) {
            // After maturity, the amount redeemed is based on the Redeemer contract's holdings of the underlying
+          return Cast.u128(
-            Cast.u128(
                s *
                    Cast.u128(
                        IRedeemer(redeemer).holdings(underlying, maturity)
                    )
            ) / _totalSupply;
-            return s;
        }

        // Prior to maturity, return a a preview of a swap on the pool
        return IYield(pool).sellFYTokenPreview(Cast.u128(s));
    }
```
