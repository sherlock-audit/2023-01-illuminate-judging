# Lender::setEtherPrice is unreliable incase of price swings of Ethereum

## Summary

The use of `setEtherPrice()` to set the ethereum price used in rate limiting is unreliable during times of market volatility and would break rate limiting functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price of ethereum has to be set by an admin account for the calculation of rate limiting. This is unreliable because the price of ethereum can swing heavily during times of high market volatility. This would break the rate limiting functionality by either allowing less or higher flow of transactions. This is more so serious because the rate limiting is supposed to protect the protocol in scenarios of instability.

```solidity
     /// @notice sets the ethereum price which is used in rate limiting
    /// @param p the new price
    /// @return bool true if the price was set
    function setEtherPrice(uint256 p)
        external
        authorized(admin)
        returns (bool)
    {
        etherPrice = p;
        return true;
    }
```
## Impact

Rate limiting functionality would be broken when it is needed most during times of high market volatility.
