# Lender::convertDecimals will return 0 when underlyingDecimals == principalDecimals

## Summary

The `convertDecimals()` function will return a value of 0 when underlyingDecimals == principalDecimals because this condition is not accounted for. This will lead to loss of funds as `convertDecimals()` is relied on in `lend` and `mint` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `convertDecimals()` function converts principal decimal amount to underlying's decimal amount as below: 

```solidity
        // Determine which asset has more decimals
        if (underlyingDecimals > principalDecimals) {
            // Shift decimals accordingly
            return a * 10**(underlyingDecimals - principalDecimals);
        }
        return a / 10**(principalDecimals - underlyingDecimals);
```

It fails to account for a condition where `underlyingDecimals == principalDecimals`. In such a scenario, the function would return a 0 (default value of uint256). This can lead to a loss of funds and break critical functionality. For example, in the `lend()` function, the `mintable` amount would be set to 0 immediately after a transfer of funds has been done.

```solidity
        // Transfer the users principal tokens to the lender contract
        Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), msg.sender, address(this), a);

        // Calculate how much should be minted based on the decimal difference
        uint256 mintable = convertDecimals(u, principal, a);
```

## Impact

This can lead to a loss of funds and break critical functionality.

## Recommendation

Make the first condition check to be `underlyingDecimals >= principalDecimals`

```solidity
        // Determine which asset has more decimals
        if (underlyingDecimals >= principalDecimals) {
            // Shift decimals accordingly
            return a * 10**(underlyingDecimals - principalDecimals);
        }
        return a / 10**(principalDecimals - underlyingDecimals);
```
