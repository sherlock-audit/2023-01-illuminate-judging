# ```setAdmin()``` should be a 2-step-process

## Summary
This protocols some of major features depend upon admin(a single entity), there is some sort of centralization here.
So its a serious concern that, while changing ```admin address``` in contracts, the admin should set properly and correctly with new admin-address, Otherwise there is chance that whole control of protocol will move to some unknown hands.

As there is always a chance for Human Error, So there should be some extra care taken when changing this type of critical state variables 

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is repeated in all contract files like in ```MarketPlace.sol```, ```Lender.sol```, ```Redeemer.sol```
```solidity
function setAdmin(address a) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {  // @audit-issue should be 2 step process
        admin = a;
        emit SetAdmin(a);
        return true;
    }
``` 

## Impact
```admin``` can mistakely set to a unknown address, that results in giving protocol's all power in a unknown hands.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should use 2 step process,

First, admin call ```changeAdmin()``` and set new_admin_address in a state variable
second, new admin will call ```claimAdmin()``` which verify ```msg.sender == new_admin_address``` and set him as admin, and delete ```new_admin_address``` state variable
