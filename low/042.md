# Concerns on pause and related to pause functions over the code

## Summary
- Pause operations doesn't include proper timelocks / access control
- Also there are pause operations in both calls for moving assets in and for moving assets (redeem) out, what is not recommended in a trust view

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a huge concern in pause as noticed in the audit scope / concerns. Reason why I choose High label

As per said in the documentation:
```
That said, we retain multiple methods for approvals / withdrawals / fees / pausing gated behind admin methods to ensure the protocol can effectively safeguard user funds during the early operation of the protocol. NOTE: For the most part these methods have delays to give time for users to exit. Further, the admin will always be a multi-sig.
```

However, no delay is used at these pause operations at:

- [Redeemer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L246-L253)

Neither access control, can be called by anyone:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add a timelock on pause operations
- Add access control to pause operations
