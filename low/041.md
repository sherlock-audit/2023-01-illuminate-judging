# ```Safe.approve(IERC20(token), r, type(uint256).max)``` will not work for some token.

## Summary
UniversalApproveMax will not work for some token that doesn't support approve type(uint256).max account

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside some contract's functions are wanting for max amount of token approval from caller so that these contract will transfer token from caller to them, but some token contract does not support this type of approval of max amount,

In that case if Protocol is accepting those type of token, then this approval.max logic will broke
```solidity
function approve(
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        address r
    ) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
        // approve the underlying for max per given principal
        for (uint8 i; i != 9; ) {
            // get the principal token's address
            address token = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, i);
            // check that the token is defined for this particular market
            if (token != address(0)) {
                // max approve the token
                Safe.approve(IERC20(token), r, type(uint256).max); // @audit-issue
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        // approve the redeemer to receive underlying from the lender
        Safe.approve(IERC20(u), r, type(uint256).max);
        return true;
    }
```
```solidity
 function approve(address i) external authorized(marketPlace) {
        if (i != address(0)) {
            Safe.approve(IERC20(i), address(converter), type(uint256).max); // @audit-issue 
        }
    }
```

## Impact
code will broke as its wanting approval of max token where token doesn't support max approval

Manual Review

## Recommendation
only request required amount of token for approval
