# Users can loose their Illuminate tokens if amount to redeem is greater than holdings[u][m]

## Summary

If the `redeem()` function for Illuminate Principal tokens is called before the `redeem` functions of the other markets, the `holdings[u][m]` will be empty and the user's tokens will be burned without receiving the underlying amount.  `token.authBurn(msg.sender, amount);` will still succeed meaning the user will loss funds.

This issue was reported in the previous Sherlock audit as Issue M11 but has not been addressed - https://app.sherlock.xyz/audits/contests/12

## Vulnerability Detail

The  `holdings[u][m]` mapping will be empty if the below function is called after maturity and before the other `redeem()` functions for other markets have been called. 

```solidity
 function redeem(address u, uint256 m) external unpaused(u, m) {
        // Get Illuminate's principal token for this market
        IERC5095 token = IERC5095(
            IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(
                u,
                m,
                uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Illuminate)
            )
        );

        // Verify the token has matured
        if (block.timestamp < token.maturity()) {
            revert Exception(7, block.timestamp, m, address(0), address(0));
        }

        // Get the amount of tokens to be redeemed from the sender
        uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(msg.sender);

        // Calculate how many tokens the user should receive
        uint256 redeemed = (amount * holdings[u][m]) / token.totalSupply();

        // Update holdings of underlying
        holdings[u][m] = holdings[u][m] - redeemed;

        // Burn the user's principal tokens
        token.authBurn(msg.sender, amount);

        // Transfer the original underlying token back to the user
        Safe.transfer(IERC20(u), msg.sender, redeemed);

        emit Redeem(0, u, m, redeemed, amount, msg.sender);
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of user funds. In addition to this, and as a result of the `token.totalSupply()` decreasing after the user's tokens are burned, users who redeem later will profit off from the user who lost funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check to confirm if the other `redeem()` functions have been run after maturity before the `redeem()` function for Illuminate Principal tokens  can be called. This could be through the use of a timestamp variable that tracks the last time a `redeem()` function was run.  If the timestamp variable indicates a time before maturity, then the redeem()` function for Illuminate Principal tokens should revert.
