# The Redeemer::setAdmin function can be used by anyone or an attacker

## Summary
the `setAdmin` function can be used by anyone with the current admin address to change the admin address. Without sufficient security mechanisms, this can lead to the admin's address being changed by a attacker who manages to find out the admin's current address, who can then take control of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
the admin address can be replaced by a attacker who manages to find out the current admin address, who can then take control of the contract. or change parameters, then a attacker who managed to change the admin address can take over the contract and perform unwanted operations.

## Impact
Redeemer.sol#L132-L136
the admin address can be replaced by a attacker who manages to find out the admin's current address, who can then take over the contract.

``` solidity
    function setAdmin(address a) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
        admin = a;
        emit SetAdmin(a);
        return true;
    }
```

Redeemer.sol#L159-L179

the converter can be overridden by a attacker who manages to find out the admin's current address, who can then take over the converter contract
``` solidity
 function setConverter(address c, address[] memory i)
        external
        authorized(admin)
        returns (bool)
    {
        // Set the new converter
        converter = c;

        // Have the redeemer approve the new converter
        for (uint256 x; x != i.length; ) {
            // Approve the new converter to transfer the relevant tokens
            Safe.approve(IERC20(i[x]), c, type(uint256).max);

            unchecked {
                x++;
            }
        }

        emit SetConverter(c);
        return true;
    }
```
Redeemer.sol#L197-L227
can be reimbursed by a attacker who manages to find out the current admin address, who can then increase the fee rate to make redemption unprofitable for the user.
``` solidity
   function setFee(uint256 f) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
        // Cache the minimum timestamp for executing a fee rate change
        uint256 feeTime = feeChange;

        // Check that a fee rate change has been scheduled
        if (feeTime == 0) {
            revert Exception(23, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));

            // Check that the scheduled fee rate change time has been passed
        } else if (block.timestamp < feeTime) {
            revert Exception(
                24,
                block.timestamp,
                feeTime,
                address(0),
                address(0)
            );
            // Check the the new fee rate is not too high
        } else if (f < MIN_FEENOMINATOR) {
            revert Exception(25, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
        }

        // Set the new fee rate
        feenominator = f;

        // Unschedule the fee rate change
        delete feeChange;

        emit SetFee(f);
        return true;
    }
```

Redemptions can be frozen by a attacker who manages to find out the admin's current address, who can then freeze Redemptions for the desired market.

Redeemer.sol#L246-l253
``` solidity
    function pauseRedemptions(
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        bool b
    ) external authorized(admin) {
        paused[u][m] = b;
        emit PauseRedemptions(u, m, b);
    }
```

    }
```
``` solidity

        return true;
    }

        // Cache the minimum timestamp for executing a fee rate change
        uint256 feeTime = feeChange;

        // Check that a fee rate change has been scheduled
        if (feeTime == 0) {

        } else if (block.timestamp < feeTime) {
            revert Exception(

## Recommendation
consider adding a multi-sig mechanism or setting the admin address to be changed only by some predefined addresses.
