# Using the low-level function ".delegatecall" it doesn't checks contract existence

## Summary
Using the low-level function ".delegatecall" it doesn't checks contract existence

## Vulnerability Detail
At https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L1076

`(bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(`

## Impact
The `.delegatecall()` function is a low-level function that allows a contract to call another contract's function using the storage, memory, and balance of the calling contract, rather than the called contract. This function does not check if the specified contract exists before it is called

the `batch()` function is using the `delegatecall()` function to call multiple other contracts' functions, as specified in the input `c` which is an array of bytes representing the `calldata` of the function to be executed.

It will only check the success of the call and if it was not successful, it will revert the transaction, the revert message is extracted using `RevertMsgExtractor.getRevertMsg(result)` which is a helper function to extract revert message.

It's important to ensure that the contracts being called using `delegatecall()` exist and are deployed on the correct network, otherwise, the transaction will fail and revert with an error message.

## Code Snippet
`(bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check and throw when the `delegatecall` in a contract.

It's important to ensure that the contracts being called using `delegatecall()` exist and are deployed on the correct network, otherwise, the transaction will fail and revert with an error message.
