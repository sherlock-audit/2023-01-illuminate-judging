## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L972-L997

                    '    function withdraw(address e) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
        // Get the minimum timestamp to withdraw the token
        uint256 when = withdrawals[e];

        // Check that the withdrawal was scheduled for the token
        if (when == 0) {
            revert Exception(18, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
        }

        // Check that it is now past the scheduled timestamp for withdrawing the token
        if (block.timestamp < when) {
            revert Exception(19, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
        }

        // Reset the scheduled withdrawal
        delete withdrawals[e];

        // Reset the fees for the token (relevant when withdrawing underlying for markets)
        delete fees[e];

        // Send the token to the admin
        IERC20 token = IERC20(e);
        Safe.transfer(token, admin, token.balanceOf(address(this)));

        return true;
    }'
