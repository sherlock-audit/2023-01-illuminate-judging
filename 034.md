# If no swap to PT, the premium is locked and there is no profit

## Summary
In Swivel's lend function, when the parameter e is true, premium is exchanged for iPT, but when e is false, premium is locked in the contract and the same amount of iPT is minted for the user, which means that premium is locked until maturity and there is no profit
## Vulnerability Detail
When the user uses Swivel's lend function, Swivel will return the premium to the Lender contract.
```solidity
            uint256 premium = (IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this)) - starting) -
                fee;
```
When the parameter `e` is true, the premium will be swapped to iPT and sent to the user
```solidity
            if (e) {
                // Swap the premium for Illuminate principal tokens
                swapped += yield(
                    u,
                    y,
                    premium,
                    msg.sender,
                    IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, 0),
                    premiumSlippage
                );
```
While when `e` is false, the premium is not refunded directly to the user, but an equal amount of iPT is minted to the user. 
Since in general, 1 UToken can be swapped to more than 1 iPT,  it actually locks the user's premium until maturity, without any profit for the user.
```solidity
            } else {
                // Send the premium to the redeemer to hold until redemption
                premiums[u][m] = premiums[u][m] + premium;

                // Account for the premium
                received = received + premium;
            }

            // Mint Illuminate principal tokens to the user
            IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, received);
```
Consider the following case where Alice calls Swivel's lend function with a maturity of 1 year.
The premium obtained in the Lend function is 1000 UToken.
When Alice chooses to swap to iPT, the 1000 UToken will be swapped to 1100 iPT, which means that Alice will get 1100 UToken when it matures
But when Alice chooses not to swap to iPT, 1000 UToken will be minted to 1000 iPT, which means Alice will get 1000 UToken when it matures, without any profit, and ALice's 1000 UTokn may be locked for 1 year.

## Impact
When the user chooses not to swap iPTs, the contract should refund the premium to the user instead of locking the user's premium without any profit for the user.
