# Changing the Illuminate PT will make users of the old iPT lose their funds

## Summary
Changing the Illuminate PT will make users of the old iPT lose their funds


## Vulnerability Detail
The `setPrincipal()` function allows the admin to change the iPT to another contract (e.g. due to a bug that needs to be worked around), without checking that there are no shares of the old one.


## Impact
If the admin changes the iPT once one is already in use, holders of the old iPT won't be able to redeem, and will have their funds lost to holders of the new iPTs.


## Code Snippet
There are no checks whether one is currently in use:
```solidity
// File: src/MarketPlace.sol : MarketPlace.setPrincipal()   #1

224        function setPrincipal(
225            uint8 p,
226            address u,
227            uint256 m,
228            address a,
229            address h,
230            address sensePeriphery
231        ) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
232            // Set the principal token in the markets mapping
233:@>         markets[u][m][p] = a;
```

Redemption of the old one relies on the `Redeemer`:
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol : ERC5095.redeem()    #2

420:                return
421:                    IRedeemer(redeemer).authRedeem(
422:                        underlying,
423:                        maturity,
424:                        msg.sender,
425:                        r,
426:                        s
427:                    );
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L420-L427

Which will fail since the modifier only knows about the new token that has been set:
```solidity
// File: src/Redeemer.sol : Redeemer.authRedeem()   #3

548        function authRedeem(
549            address u,
550            uint256 m,
551            address f,
552            address t,
553            uint256 a
554        )
555            external
556 @>         authorized(IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, 0))
557            unpaused(u, m)
558            returns (uint256)
559        {
560            // Get the principal token for the given market
561:           IERC5095 pt = IERC5095(IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, 0));
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Don't allow over-writing the old iPT if it exists, or introduce a migration function that will give old holders shares of the new contract
