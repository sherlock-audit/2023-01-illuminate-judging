# Holders of worthless external PTs can stick other Illuminate PT holders with bad debts

## Summary
Holders of worthless external PTs can stick other Illuminate PT holders with bad debts


## Vulnerability Detail

Some of the supported external PTs can pause their activity. One such PT, Pendle, not only can pause activity, but can turn on [emergency mode](https://docs.pendle.finance/docs/information/others/pausing-mechanism#pausingmanager-contract) where the admin can transfer the underlying tokens to an [arbitrary contract](https://github.com/pendle-finance/pendle-core/blob/b34d265e4fe8e3a6f79bdec1ab88ab2fd49a882c/contracts/core/abstract/PendleForgeBase.sol#L98-L105) for safekeeping until they decide what to do with the funds. The Illuminate code does not handle such cases, and in fact, if the Pendle protocol is in emergency mode, will still allow users to convert their possibly worthless Pendle PTs to Illuminate ones.

While there is a mechanism for the Illuminate admin to pause a market, there's no guarantee that the Illuminate admin will notice the Pendle pause before other users, and even if they do, it's possible that users have automation set up to front-run such pauses for Pendle markets, so that they never are stuck with worthless tokens.

## Impact

_Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield_

Other users that deposited principal in the form of external PTs (e.g. by minting Illuminate PTs in order to be pool liquidity providers) that have actual value, will have their shares of available underlying diluted by Pendle PTs that cannot be redeemed. Illuminate PTs are on a per-share basis rather than a one-for-one basis, so the less underlying there is at redemption time, the less underlying every Illuminate PT holder gets.


## Code Snippet
There are no checks that the protocol of the external PT is paused or has any value:

```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.mint()   #1

331        function mint(
332            uint8 p,
333            address u,
334            uint256 m,
335            uint256 a
336        ) external nonReentrant unpaused(u, m, p) returns (bool) {
337            // Fetch the desired principal token
338            address principal = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, p);
339    
340            // Disallow mints if market is not initialized
341            if (principal == address(0)) {
342                revert Exception(26, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
343            }
344    
345            // Get the maturity of the principal token
346            uint256 maturity;
347            if (p == uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Illuminate)) {
348                revert Exception(32, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
349            } else if (p == uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Swivel)) {
...
361            } else if (p == uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Notional)) {
362                maturity = Maturities.notional(principal);
363            }
364    
365            // Confirm that the principal token has not matured yet
366            if (block.timestamp > maturity || maturity == 0) {
367                revert Exception(
368                    7,
369                    maturity,
370                    block.timestamp,
371                    address(0),
372                    address(0)
373                );
374            }
375    
376            // Transfer the users principal tokens to the lender contract
377            Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), msg.sender, address(this), a);
378    
379            // Calculate how much should be minted based on the decimal difference
380            uint256 mintable = convertDecimals(u, principal, a);
381    
382            // Confirm that minted iPT amount will not exceed rate limit for the protocol
383            rateLimit(p, u, mintable);
384    
385            // Mint the tokens received from the user
386            IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, mintable);
387    
388            emit Mint(p, u, m, mintable);
389    
390            return true;
391:       }

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Ensure that the protocol being used as principal is not paused before allowing minting

This is the same issue as was found in the [prior contest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate-judging/issues/119), and has not been addressed. There have been changes to rate-limit minting to blunt the impact of such cases, but a non-zero limit still means that user principal is at risk.
