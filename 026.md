# Lender::rateLimit will revert for ERC20 tokens with greater than 27 decimals

## Summary

For ERC20 tokens with greater than 27 decimals, the `rateLimit` function will revert. This will prevent `mint` and `lend` from being executed even when the rateLimit has not been reached.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `rateLimit()` function calculates the `valueToMint` as `valueToMint = valueToMint * 10**(27 - IERC20(u).decimals());`. For ERC20 tokens with greater than 27 decimals, there will be an underflow which will prevent `mint` and `lend` from being executed even when the rateLimit has not been reached.

It should not be assumed that the decimals of ERC20 tokens will never be greater than 27 especially when interacting with external protocols that are dynamic.

## Impact

For ERC20 tokens with greater than 27 decimals, there will be an underflow which will prevent `mint` and `lend` from being executed even when the rateLimit has not been reached.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L1255-L1256

```solidity
        // Normalize the value to be minted to 27 decimals
        valueToMint = valueToMint * 10**(27 - IERC20(u).decimals());
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace `valueToMint = valueToMint * 10**(27 - IERC20(u).decimals());` with

```solidity
        if (IERC20(u).decimals()) <= 27 ) {
            valueToMint = valueToMint * 10**(27 - IERC20(u).decimals());
        } else {
            valueToMint = valueToMint / 10**(IERC20(u).decimals() - 27);
       }
```
