# Protocol fees not taken on premium

## Summary

Protocol fees not taken on premium


## Vulnerability Detail
The Swivel version of `lend()` allows the user to use any extra underlying premium from their Swivel orders, to buy more iPTs via a swap or minting directly, but no fee is taken from this premium.


## Impact
Rather than using the Illuminate version of `lend()`, which charges a fee, users could use the Swivel version, and ensure the fee portion is small, and the premium non-fee portion is large, so that Illuminate misses out on fees.


## Code Snippet
The fee is calculated based on the amount listed in the orders:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.lend()   #1

488            // Lent represents the total amount of underlying to be lent
489 @>         uint256 lent = swivelAmount(a);
490    
491            // Get the underlying balance prior to calling initiate
492            uint256 starting = IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this));
493    
494            // Transfer underlying token from user to Illuminate
495            Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), msg.sender, address(this), lent);
496    
497            // Calculate fee for the total amount to be lent
498:@>         uint256 fee = lent / feenominator;
```

But the premium is the balance change after the orders have executed (can be thought of as positive slippage):
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.lend()   #2
525                // Calculate the premium
526 @>             uint256 premium = (IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this)) - starting) -
527:                   fee;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L525-L527

And no fee is charged on this premium, either when swapping in the yield pool, or when minting iPTs directly.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Calculate the fee after the order, on the full balance change

This is similar to a [finding](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate-judging/issues/45) from the previous contest, but the mitigation was to remove the amount fee from the premium, but didn't address the fee for the premium itself
