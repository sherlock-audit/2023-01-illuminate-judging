# ERC5095::deposit does not account for slippage as intended

## Summary

The `ERC5095::deposit` has a logic flaw where instead of comparing the returned amount to the expected amount. It compares it to the deposited amount therefore failing to account for slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The  `ERC5095::deposit`  function checks whether a user receives at least the amount desired as follows:

```solidity
       // Preview how many shares are needed to withdraw the desired amount of underlying
        uint128 shares = Cast.u128(previewDeposit(a));

        // Receive the funds from the sender
        Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, address(this), a);

        // consider the hardcoded slippage limit, 4626 compliance requires no minimum param.
        uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
            underlying,
            maturity,
            Cast.u128(a),
            shares
        );

        // Ensure the user received at least the amount desired
        if (returned < a)  {
            revert Exception(16, returned, a, address(0), address(0));
        }
```

As can be seen, the check `if (returned < a) ` wrongfully compares the returned amount with the deposited amount (a). Instead the comparision should be `if (returned < shares) `  as `shares` is what is calculated by the `previewDeposit()` function as the desired amount. `shares` again is the value passed to `sellUnderlying` as the minimum number of PTs that must be received.

```solidity
uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
            underlying,
            maturity,
            Cast.u128(a),
            shares
        );
```
It is expected that the returned amount of shares can be less than the deposited amount due to slippage but the function will revert due to the incorrect check.

## Impact

The `deposit()` function will fail when slippage happens. This would break the operation of the protocol as users may be prevented from depositing funds.

## Recommendation

Change the check in `ERC5095::deposit` from `if (returned < a) ` to  `if (returned < shares) `.

Alternatively, the check can be omiited altogether as `IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying()` will already have a slippage check correctly in the line ` if (expected < s)`.
