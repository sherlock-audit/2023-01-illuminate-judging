```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public fees;
    /// @notice maps a token address to a point in time, a hold, after which a withdrawal can be made
    mapping(address => uint256) public withdrawals;
```
## Impact
Insufficient mapping to approve multi fees & withdrawals and This implementation doesnâ€™t support multi-tokens.
