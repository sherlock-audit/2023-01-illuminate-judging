# EIP-5095 Early Use & False Adherence Risk

## Summary

 [ERC5095.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol) does not perfectly comply with the current [EIP-5095 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095). EIP-5095 is also currently "not recommended for general use or implementation as it is likely to change" ([EIP-5095](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095)). Lack of adherence to the current EIP-5095 specification along with the "likely" changes that could come to the specification poses possible user asset risk from adherence assumptions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [redeem](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095#redeem) and [withdraw](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095#withdraw) functions MUST emit a [`redeem` event](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095#events) to comply with EIP-5095. [ERC5095.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol) does not have a `redeem`  event. There is also no function explicitly named [convertToPrincipal](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095#converttoprincipal) in [ERC5095.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol).

## Impact

Compliance assumptions by users could result in a loss of funds. For example, if a user assumes the existence of a function that "MUST not revert" (in the case of [convertToPrincipal](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095#converttoprincipal) with the exception of overflows) and a revert happens (function does not exist), their logic may fail (possibly resulting in a material loss of funds).

## Code Snippet

See [ERC5095.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L1-L488).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Comply with the [current EIP-5095 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095). Be cautious of changes to the EIP-5095 specification as it is in draft.
