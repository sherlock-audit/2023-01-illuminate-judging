# Depositors can lose their entire deposit

## Summary
If `autoRedeem` is called after a `market` matures but before any calls to a `redeem` function and the addresses passed into the `autoRedeem` function approved the `redeemer` contract to move their funds, those customers will lose their entire principal token balance. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There's the potential for time to pass between a `market` maturing and someone calling `autoRedeem`.  When `autoRedeem` is called there aren't any checks to make sure that the `holdings` mapping value is greater than zero. If a call to `autoRedeem` were to happen when the `holdings` mapping is zero, `redeemed` would be zero
```solidity
uint256 redeemed = (amount * holdings[u][m]) / pt.totalSupply();
```
and
```solidity
uint256 amount = pt.balanceOf(f[i]);
...
pt.authBurn(f[i], amount);
```
the total principal token balance of each address passed in would be burned without the addresses receiving any underlying due to them.

## Impact
Customers' entire principal token balance is burned without them receiving any underlying
