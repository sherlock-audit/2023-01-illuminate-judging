# The Notional version of `lend()` can be used to lock iPTs

## Summary
The Notional version of `lend()` can be used to lock extra iPTs in the `Lender` contract


## Vulnerability Detail
The Notional version of `lend()` has no checks to ensure that the principal value, `p`, passed in is for Notional, and therefore the Illuminate principal value can be passed in and used, which will allow callers to buy iPTs to the `Lender` contract (rather than Notional PTs), and then mint a second one to themselves when the iPT is minted at the end of the function.


## Impact
When the underlying is sold in the marketplace, the resulting iPT is given to the `Lender` contract, and there is no supported way to have those iPTs redeemed and their underlying released, which means when users try to redeem their own iPTs, there will be less underlying available than there should be, and they will have lost principal.


## Code Snippet
In the code block below, there are no checks that `p` is for notional, and the market-provided token for that `p` is used directly for depositing, and at the end of the function, more iPTs are minted:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.lend()   #1

875      function lend(
876          uint8 p,
877          address u,
878          uint256 m,
879          uint256 a,
880          uint256 r
881      ) external nonReentrant unpaused(u, m, p) matured(m) returns (uint256) {
882          // Instantiate Notional princpal token
883 @>       address token = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).markets(u, m, p);
884  
885          // Transfer funds from user to Illuminate
886          Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), msg.sender, address(this), a);
...  
894          // Swap on the Notional Token wrapper
895 @>       uint256 received = INotional(token).deposit(a - fee, address(this));
896  
897          // Convert decimals from principal token to underlying
898          received = convertDecimals(u, token, received); 
...
908          // Mint Illuminate zero coupons
909:@>       IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, received);
```

The `deposit()` function sells the underlying for iPTs, using the marketplace:
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol : ERC5095.deposit()   #2

191        // consider the hardcoded slippage limit, 4626 compliance requires no minimum param.
192        uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
193            underlying,
194            maturity,
195            Cast.u128(a),
196            shares
197:        );
```

NOTE: `INotional` is an [ERC4626](https://github.com/notional-finance/wrapped-fcash/blob/ad5c145d9988eeee6e36cf93cc3412449e4e7eba/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L7) token, and the `deposit()` function comes from that [interface](https://github.com/notional-finance/wrapped-fcash/blob/ad5c145d9988eeee6e36cf93cc3412449e4e7eba/interfaces/IERC4626.sol#L99). While the Illuminate PT's `deposit()` function has a [different signature](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L173) (the argument order is flipped), it's clear that this is a mistake that will be corrected as a part of this audit, since comments within the `deposit()` function itself refer to the need to be [compliant with the ERC4626 standard](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L191), and discussions in the prior audit extensively mention that compliance was in fact [_necessary_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate-judging/issues/114#issuecomment-1318241460), and the `deposit()` function is not a part of the [EIP-5095 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095).

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Revert if `p` is not `MarketPlace.Principals.Notional`
