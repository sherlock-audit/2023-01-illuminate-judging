# Illuminate's PT doesn't respect users' slippage specifications for underlyings

## Summary
Illuminate's PT doesn't respect users' slippage specifications for underlyings, and allows more slippage than is requested

## Vulnerability Detail
`ERC5095.withdraw()`/`redeem()`'s code adds extra underlying slippage on top of what the user requests

## Impact
At the end of withdrawal/redemption, the user will end up receiving less underlying than they asked for, due to slippage. If the user had used a external PT to mint the Illuminate PT, they will have lost part of their principal.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol : ERC5095.withdraw()   #1

271                    uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellPrincipalToken(
272                        underlying,
273                        maturity,
274                        shares,
275 @>                     Cast.u128(a - (a / 100))
276:                   );

305                        Cast.u128(shares),
306 @>                     Cast.u128(a - (a / 100))

`redeem()` has the [same](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L380-L385) [issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L404-L409)

Manual Review


## Recommendation
This is the same issue that I described in the [last contest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate-judging/issues/114). In the original issue, the finding was disputed because there wasn't a clean solution for slippage protection on the number of shares burned in order to satisfy the input underlying amount. During the discussion of the issue, it became clear that the `ERC5095` contract was supposed to be cross-compatable with the `ERC4626` standard, and that standard has this to say:

`If implementors intend to support EOA account access directly, they should consider adding an additional function call for deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem with the means to accommodate slippage loss or unexpected deposit/withdrawal limits, since they have no other means to revert the transaction if the exact output amount is not achieved.
` https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626

In other words, it's not up to the `ERC4626`/`ERC5095` contract implementation itself to determine whether too many shares needed to be burned in order to satisfy the request for exactly the provided number of underlying - it's up to the caller to have extra code to determine whether the number is satsifactory itself. Note though that both standards are very clear that the _exact_ number of underlying _must_ be provided back, and the implmentation as it stands does _not_ do this.
